# grocery-tracker

This application is for the forgetful individuals who can not remember what groceries they do or do not have when shopping.

The aim for this project is create a fast and easy to use application that tracks groceries by using bar code scanning technology.

This is a work in progress project.

My goal is to learn and utilize React Native, Docker, AWS, golang, and many more to create this project.
